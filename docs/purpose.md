Purpose of this book
===================

### ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š Unify teamwork style
Do things the same way, and we can:

* switch between each others work with less brain drain.
* answer questions about projects the same way.

### ðŸ¤” Ease congnitive load
We all want to be using our brains for figuring out how to implement actual logic of features rather than the architecture of it.

### ðŸ“› Naming conventions

?> ðŸ’¬ "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things" - Phil Karlton

By sticking to a naming convention for filenames, variables and properties, we:

* establish the basis of a common language.
* make it easier to find stuff.

### ðŸš… Performance orientated habits
Describe patterns that lead to good performance


### ðŸ‘´ Handle legacy requirements
By default our supported browser policy is *Current -1*, meaning that what ever the latest version of a browser is we write code to work in that version and the one before it.

Sometimes we are tasked with supporting *Current -2* or even *-3*, in those cases we need an established methodology that handles those cases.
